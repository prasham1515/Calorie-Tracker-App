## About the app ##
The system allows you to see and track if you've ingested the recommended daily calorie intake. After inputting the name, the
website will request user information such as age, gender, height, weight, and lifestyle activity. Users under the age of 18 are not allowed to fill out this form.The program takes into account of pregnant and lactating women too. The website asks the user what they've eaten and how much they've eaten after they've entered these facts. The program will compute how much the user has ingested and the percentage of each nutrient that the user has consumed or still to consume based on the nutritional values of the food items per 100 grams.
